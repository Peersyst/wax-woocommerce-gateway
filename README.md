#Wax Woocommerce Payment Gateway

EOS Barcelona (https://eos.barcelona/) in collaboration with Peersyst Technology (https://www.peersyst.com/), launch the first wordpress plugin that allows accepting payments in WAXP (www.wax.io).

This plugin will allow you to offer the products of your store based on Wordpress and Woocomerce to a new audience.

Automatically convert the balances of your purchases to Wax and pay through the Wax Cloud Wallet (https://all-access.wax.io/)

Thanks to this interface fully integrated into Woocomerce, now you can use this payment method together with others such as Stripe or Paypal in addition to using any other plugin compatible with Woocommerce.

List your products in USD / EUR, in WAXP or in USD / EUR and WAXP.

Thanks to the ease of access of the Wax Cloud Wallet, any user can register their account and pay through this payment system.

##How does it work?

###Installation

Upload wax-woocommerce-payment-gateway to the /wp-content/plugins/directory OR download it from the WordPress repository

You can also download it directly from this link and add it as a ZIP

The plugin contains a process that checks the transactions made on the WAX blockchain every 5 seconds. Once the payment is received, your order will be processed normally.
